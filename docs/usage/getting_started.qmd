After installing `fasttrackpy`, you can use the `fasttrack` commandline executable in one of two ways.

## Audio File Only Processing

You can process either a single audio file or a directory of audio files with `fasttrack audio`. To use the `fasttrack` defaults, just provide `fasttrack audio` with the path to the input file or directory, and an output file or directory.


```bash
fasttrack audio --file assets/audio/ay.wav --dest assets/audio
```

This will save the formant tracks for this single wav file to `assets/audio/ay.csv/`.

To process an entire directory of files, instead pass the directory to `--dir`.

```bash
fasttrack audio --dir assets/audio/ --dest assets/audio
```

This will save the formant tracks for each audio file with the same file name to the output directory.

## Audio File + TextGrid Processing

You can process an audio file + textgrid combination with `fasttrack audio-textgrid`. The defaults assume you are passing a textgrid with a Word and Phone tier from forced alignment, but this can be overriden.

```bash
fasttrack audio-textgrid --audio speaker.wav \
    --textgrid speaker.TextGrid \
    --dest output
```

### Adjusting the assumed TextGrid format

If your textgrid is *not* formatted as force aligned textgrid, you need to pass `--textgrid-format` the value `SequenceInterval` and `--target-tier` the name of the tier you want to analyze.


```bash
fasttrack audio-textgrid --audio speaker.wav \
    --textgrid speaker.TextGrid \
    --dest output \
    --textgrid-format SequenceInterval \
    --target-tier phones
```

### Adjusting the target intervals

You can configure fasttrack to only process certain intervals by passing `--target-labels` a regular expression matching values in your textgrid. For example, if you have segmented only the vowels you want to analyze, you can pass `--target-labels` the value `"."`.

```bash
fasttrack audio-textgrid --audio speaker.wav \
    --textgrid speaker.TextGrid \
    --dest output \
    --textgrid-format SequenceInterval \
    --target-tier phones \
    --target-labels "."
```


## Using a config file

There are many possible options to set for both `fasttrack audio` and `fasttrack audio-textgrid`. Instead of passing them all at the commandline, you can pass either command a yaml config file.

```yaml
# config.yml
min_max_formant: 3000
max_max_formant: 6000
nstep: 10
```

```bash
fasttrack audio --file ay.wav \
    --dest output \
    --config config.yml
```
